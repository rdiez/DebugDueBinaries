This is the source file from which the README file is generated.

This file is written in Perl's Plain Old Documentation (POD) format.
Run the following Perl commands to convert it to text or to HTML
for easy reading:

  pod2text README.pod >README.txt

  # pod2html seems buggy, at least in perl v5.10.1, therefore
  # I'm using this long one-liner instead (with bash):
  perl -MPod::Simple::HTML  -e "\$p = Pod::Simple::HTML->new; \$p->index( 1 ); \$p->output_fh( *STDOUT{IO} ); \$p->force_title('JtagDue'); \$p->parse_file('README.pod');"  >README.html

This file is best edited with emacs module pod-mode, available in CPAN.
However, the POD syntax is quite simple and can be edited with a standard text editor.
